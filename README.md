### (Inheritance, Interfaces, and Modular Design)

---

## Overview

This project implements a **Student Management System** demonstrating essential object-oriented concepts:

- **Inheritance**
- **Interfaces**
- **Polymorphism**
- **Abstract Classes**
- **Method Overriding**
- **Method Overloading**
- **Modular Design**

The system includes:

- An **abstract class `Person`** with common fields such as name and email  
- A **`Student` class** extending `Person` with roll number, course, marks, and grade  
- An **interface `RecordActions`** defining methods to add, update, delete, and view students
